new video loaded: Highlights From Trump’s Impeachment Defensetranscript“Like every other politically motivated witch hunt the left has engaged in over the past four years, this impeachment is completely divorced from the facts, the evidence and the interests of the American people.” “To claim that the president in any way wished, desired or encouraged lawless or violent behavior is a preposterous and monstrous lie.” “A small group who came to engage in violent and menacing behavior hijacked the event for their own purposes.” “This sham impeachment also poses a serious threat to freedom of speech for political leaders of both parties at every level of government. The Senate should be extremely careful about the president, the precedent, this case will set.” “We heard a lot this week about ‘fight like hell,’ but they cut off the video before they showed you the president’s optimistic, patriotic words that followed immediately after.” “Fight like hell, and if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore. Our exciting adventures and boldest endeavors have not yet begun. My fellow Americans, for our movement, for our children and for our beloved country, and I say this despite all that’s happened, the best is yet to come.” “This case, unfortunately, is about political hatred. It has become very clear that the House Democrats hate Donald Trump. This type of political hatred has no place in our political institutions, and certainly no place in the law. This hatred has led the House managers to manipulate and selectively edit Mr. Trump’s speech to make it falsely appear that he sought to incite the crowd to violently attack the Capitol.” “Suddenly, the word ‘fight’ is off limits? Spare us the hypocrisy and false indignation. It’s a term used over and over and over again by politicians on both sides of the aisle. And of course, the Democrat House managers know that the word ‘fight’ has been used figuratively in political speech forever. But don’t take it from me. It’s best to listen to them.” “We are in a fight.” “We are in a fight.” “Democrats are fighting as hard as we can.” “Democrats are standing up to fight.” “We know how to fight. We like a good fight.” “Democrats are going to fight like hell.” “We fight like hell.” “So why are we here? Politics. Their goal is to eliminate a political opponent. To substitute their judgment for the will of the voters.” “We will not take most of our time today, us of the defense, in the hopes that you will take back these hours and use them to get delivery of Covid relief to the American people.”1:371:57LIVE1:25NOW PLAYING1:191:584:001:110:59
