Join Times reporters for live coverage of former President Donald J. Trump’s second Senate impeachment trial. The proceeding began Tuesday with a debate about the constitutionality the trial, followed by presentations by the prosecution and defense. Today Senators will hear closing statements.Leahy is now saying that the evidentiary portion of the trial is closed.Impeachment manager Representative Madeleine Dean, Democrat of Pennsylvania, now repeating their side’s description of the three main elements of Trump’s incitement:The Big LieStop the StealFight Like Hell We’re seeing a montage of Trump declaring that the election was rigged and fraudulent for most of 2020.Rep. Dean is making the case that Trump seeded the violence at the Capitol over a period of many months and that it was not just his Jan. 6 speech that caused it.The “Stop the Steal” movement brought together extremists from all over the country, believing in the lie Trump won the election.After the election, Ali Alexander, the Stop the Steal organizer, emerged as a vocal proponent of the president’s stolen election claims, setting up a Stop the Steal website on Nov. 4 and making incendiary statements. On Dec. 8, he tweeted that he was willing to give up his life to keep Mr. Trump in office.The clips House managers have focused on from Trump’s Jan. 6 speech to his followers just before the riot rarely include what was arguably the most insidious thing, probably because it is far more subtle than the “fight like hell” bits and it takes a minute to parse. Trump said that the Republican officials like Pence and McConnell who accepted Biden’s win were being brave — insinuating it would be safer for them to go along with his efforts to overturn the results.(“If Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the election. … And I actually — I just spoke to Mike. I said: ‘Mike, that doesn’t take courage. What takes courage is to do nothing. That takes courage.’ … “I also want to thank our 13 most courageous members of the U.S. Senate, Senator Ted Cruz, Senator Ron Johnson, Senator Josh Hawley. … Senators have stepped up. We want to thank them. I actually think, though, it takes, again, more courage not to step up, and I think a lot of those people are going to find that out. And you better start looking at your leadership, because your leadership has led you down the tubes.”) During the riot, famously, Trump’s supporters chanted "hang Mike Pence!”There’s apparently some confusion as to which videos have already been played by the House managersSenator Leahy said that new evidence cannot be introduced, so new videos cannot be shown. There appears to be some confusion as to which videos the House managers have already shown.The House impeachment managers have used up about half their time for closing arguments so far.The procedural snafus we’ve seen are a reminder of how rare impeachment trials are, even though we’ve seen two in about a year.Rep. Joe Neguse is up now making his closing argument for the Democrats.I’m not sure about the logic of that last appeal by Representative Madeleine Dean. It seems like if history won’t remember you as an individual senator, only the result of what the body as a whole did, that’s less rather than more of a reason for any individual Republican senator to vote to convict Trump and thereby risk losing his or her seat in a primary challenge.As the trial winds down, it’s worth remembering that the federal inquiry into the crimes that were committed on Jan. 6 is really just beginning. Our colleagues Alan Feuer and Nicole Hong have just posted a story on what’s ahead.       As Impeachment Nears End, Federal Inquiry Looms as Reminder of Trump’s Role in Riot    2:14 PM    Rep. Neguse says of the former president’s decision not to testify: “You can’t claim there’s no due process when you won’t participate in the process.”The argument in Alan Feuer’s and Nicole Hong’s analytical piece is that the continuing criminal investigations into the actual rioters and their eventual trials may surface or keep in the air evidence that will further damage Trump’s reputation – even though his own actions are not a focus of those inquiries – thereby complicating any 2024 run by him even though the Senate appears unlikely to convict him and disqualify him from holding future office.Charlie, to that end, Trump is facing other investigations.
