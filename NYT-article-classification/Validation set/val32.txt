new video loaded: Senate Votes to Allow Witnesses in Trump’s Impeachment Trialtranscript“We believe we’ve proven our case. But last night Congresswoman Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington State issued a statement confirming that in the middle of the insurrection, when House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy called the president to beg for help, President Trump responded, and I quote, ‘Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are.’ Needless to say, this is an additional critical piece of corroborating evidence, further confirming the charges before you. We would like the opportunity to subpoena Congresswoman Herrera regarding her communications with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, and to subpoena her contemporaneous notes that she made regarding what President Trump told Kevin McCarthy in the middle of the insurrection.” “They put into their case over a hundred witnesses, people, who have been charged with crimes by the federal government. And each one of those, they said that Mr. Trump was a co-conspirator with, that’s not true. But I have the right to defend that. The only thing that I ask, if you vote for witnesses, do not handcuff me by limiting the number of witnesses that I can have. Now is the time to end this. Now is the time to hear the closing arguments. Now is the time to vote your conscience.” “On the question of whether it shall be in order to consider and debate under the rules of impeachment any motion to subpoena witnesses or document, the motion is agreed to by a vote of 55 to 45.”1:37NOW PLAYINGLIVE1:253:521:191:584:001:110:59
