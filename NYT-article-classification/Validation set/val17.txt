Trump issued a warning as the proceedings began on Wednesday: not appropriate for young children.“We do urge parents and teachers to exercise close review of what young people are watching here,” Representative Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland, said before showing video of what he called the “shocking violence, bloodshed and pain” inflicted by the violent mob on Capitol Hill on Jan. 6.Mr. Raskin’s message was ostensibly for parents watching at home. But the subtext was not lost on those in the Senate chamber, where the second impeachment trial of Mr. Trump was unfolding: House managers who were victims of the attack were speaking to senators who themselves had survived the violent assault. Around them were their staffs who had cowered behind office desks as the mob rampaged through the building. Above them in the balcony, scribbling in notepads, were journalists who were equally traumatized and security officers who had been there to ward off the attackers.The humming rhythms of Capitol Hill do not easily allow for prolonged moments of reflection, let alone in the aftermath of an insurrection. But the video evidence procured by the impeachment managers turned the nation’s most powerful lawmakers into a captive audience, forcing them to absorb the enormity of the attack and render judgment on whether Mr. Trump deserved blame for what they had witnessed.transcript“Radio communications from the Metropolitan Police Department highlight how, during and and following President Trump’s speech, Trump supporters descended on the Capitol, and became increasingly violent. What you are about to hear has not been made public before.” “In another radio communication between Metropolitan Police officers, you can hear an officer declare that there is a riot at the capital at 1:49 p.m.” “We are seeing the inside view as the mob approaches from outside and beats the windows and doors. You can see that the rioters first broke the window with the wooden beam that you saw previously, and a lone police officer inside responds and begins to spray the first man who enters, but is quickly overwhelmed. I want you to pay attention to the first group of assailants as they break into the building. The second man through the window is wearing full tactical body armor and is carrying a baseball bat. Others are carrying riot shields. Among this group are members of the Proud Boys, some of whom, like Dominic Pezzola, who was recently indicted on federal conspiracy charges, we will discuss later. In this security footage, you can see Officer Goodman running to respond to the initial breach. Officer Goodman passes Senator Mitt Romney, and directs him to turn around in order to get to safety. On the first floor, just beneath them, the mob had already started to search for the Senate chamber. Officer Goodman made his way down to the first floor. On the left-hand side of the video, just inside the hallway, is the door to the Senate chamber. And watch how officer Goodman provokes the rioters and purposefully draws them away from the door to the Senate chamber and towards the other officers waiting down the hall. The rioter seen carrying a baseball bat in this video is the same one we saw moments ago, breaching the window on the first floor. While all of this was going on, Vice President Pence was still in the room near the Senate chamber. It was not until to 2:26 that he was evacuated to a secure location. This next security video shows that evacuation. His movements are depicted by the orange dot in our model — the red and blue dots represent the location where the mob and Officer Goodman were, and where Officer Goodman led the mob away from the chamber, just moments ago. You can see Vice President Pence and his family quickly moved down the stairs. The vice president turns around briefly as he’s headed down. About the same time Capitol Police announced the Capitol had been breached, Speaker Pelosi’s staff heeded the call to shelter in place. As you can see here, the staff moves from their offices, through the halls, and then enters a door on the right hand side. That’s the outer door of a conference room, which also has an inner door that they barricaded with furniture. The staff then hid under a conference room table in that inner room. This is the last staffer going in and then barricading themselves inside of the inner office. After just seven minutes of them barricading themselves, and the last staffer entering the door on the right, a group of rioters entered the hallway outside. And once inside, the rioters have free rein in the speaker of the House’s offices. In this security video, pay attention to the door that we saw those staffers leading into and going into. One of the rioters, you can see, is throwing his body against the door three times until he breaks open that outer door. Luckily, when faced with the inner door, he moves on.” “This security footage, which does not have sound, shows a close-up of Trump’s mob as they move toward the second floor of the House chamber to stop the counting of votes. This security video shows Ashli Babbitt, followed by others in the mob, turning the corner toward the House lobby doors where the members were leaving. This security video from 2:56 p.m. shows the mob in the House of Representatives wing on the second floor of the Capitol. Insurrectionists who are still inside the building are fighting with the police, who are overwhelmed and trying to get them out. In this security video, you can see how the Capitol Police created a line and blocked the hallway with their bodies to prevent rioters at the end of the hall from reaching you and your staff. Additional security footage shows how leader Schumer and the members of his protective detail had a near miss with the mob. They came within just yards of rioters and had to turn around. Going up the ramp with his detail, he’ll soon go out of view. Seconds later, they return and run back down the hallway, and officers immediately shut the door and use their bodies to keep them safe. Here’s an audio recording from the radio traffic of the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department describing the violence.” “In a separate Metropolitan Police Department radio traffic recording, you can hear an officer when he realizes that the insurrectionists had overtaken the police line.” “Hours after members of the House and Senate had left this area, on the west front of the building, the mob continued to grow, continued to beat the officers as they tried to get in. In this new security video, you can see the mob attacking officers with a crutch, a hockey stick, a bullhorn and a Trump flag.”“We have to relive it,” said Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, though he predicted some staff members would most likely avoid watching video of the deadly attack again. “It’s painful. It brings up a very traumatic moment. But it also helps to bring closure, so I think it’s something that we have to go through. But it reminds us just how tragic a day it was.”The senators watched mostly in silence as the images of the rioters were displayed, the audio of their profane taunts and threats echoing off the walls. As the footage played, some senators appeared to involuntarily trace the path they took away from the chamber as it became clear how close they had been to the mob. Included in the presentation was previously unreleased footage of Officer Eugene Goodman, who has been widely praised as a hero, redirecting Senator Mitt Romney of Utah away from the mob; rioters coming within steps of Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader; and others beating on the door of an office in which members of Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s staff had barricaded themselves.“I was very fortunate indeed that Officer Goodman was there to get me in the right direction,” Mr. Romney told reporters afterward.Ms. Pelosi’s staff watched the video together and later recounted how the sounds of the attack stay with them: the screams in the Rotunda and the force with which the rioters beat on the door.“You were just 58 steps away” from the mob, Representative Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California and one of the impeachment managers, told the senators.The pleas from overwhelmed police officers filled the marble chamber, the noise almost deafening in a room where a pen click is often audible.Seated in the chamber, several senators appeared visibly distressed: There were sharp intakes of breath during footage of rioters cursing Ms. Pelosi, tightened fingers on armrests and, in the case of Mr. Schumer, a slow nodding of the head as he watched himself flee the mob. Several senators left for a dinner recess with red eyes, visibly emotional and avoiding questions.Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii, called the video evidence “gut-wrenching.”“The historical weight of the insurrection resonated today for a lot of members,” Mr. Schatz said. “Frankly, I think there were some colleagues on the other side of the aisle that hadn’t quite grasped the threat that we were under, physically, and the real peril for American democracy. Whether that moves any votes, I have no idea. But you could feel the weight in the air, and you feel the emotion in the room.”Even the videos that have long been available publicly were new for several senators. And while it is easy, amid the rush of government business, to miss the latest video or scroll past the graphic details, the rules of the trial kept most senators frozen in place.“We were witnesses to that in some ways, and in a lot of ways we weren’t — we weren’t watching that live on TV like other people were,” Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, said after the first day of the proceedings concluded on Tuesday. “That’s probably the longest time I’ve spent actually watching video on that topic. It reminded me of what a horrendous day it was.”The effects of the Jan. 6 breach are still emerging. This week, 27 Democratic senators, led by Michael Bennet of Colorado, Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, requested additional resources to support the mental health needs of employees working in the Capitol complex.The senators wrote in a statement that “demand for existing mental health programs has surged” since the attack, and they called for expanding the emotional and behavioral health services and resources available to congressional staff members, janitorial and food service workers, the press corps and the Capitol Police.Mr. Cardin recalled his personal experience on Jan. 6, when he was whisked away to a secure location and his family grew “very much concerned” about his safety. He said no one was supposed to know where his hideaway was, but his granddaughter found him using a phone locator app.“She told my whole family where I was,” Mr. Cardin said.“It was one of the roughest days of our life,” he said. “We didn’t realize how much at risk we were. You knew we were at risk, but we didn’t know it was that much. I mean, literally, we could have been all wiped out.”Nearly 140 police officers from two departments were injured during the violence, including officers who sustained brain injuries, smashed spinal disks and one who is likely to lose his eye. Five people died during the rioting.Senator James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma, who had planned to question the election results before backing off after the mob attack, appeared to grow emotional in the chamber as he watched video of an officer being crushed in a door. Afterward, he called the video “painful to see.”“Who in God’s name thinks, ‘I am going to show that I am right by smashing into the Capitol’?” Mr. Lankford asked.As they revisited the horrors of the day, senators said they would not be swayed by emotion and would allow facts and logic to dictate their decisions — even as they acknowledged the visceral impact of the images.Susan Collins of Maine, one of six Republicans who joined 50 Democrats to move forward with the trial, said the presentation “reinforces my belief that it was a terrible day for our country and that there’s no doubt that it was an attempt to disrupt the counting of the electoral votes.”She added that she was “proud of the fact that we came back that night and finished our constitutional duty — we did not let the rioters accomplish their goal of disrupting the vote.”Senator Richard J. Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat, said the videos shown in the Senate were “more explicit than anything I’ve ever seen on television.”But Mr. Durbin said no video would ever be as emotionally taxing for him as attending the service last week of Brian D. Sicknick, the Capitol Police officer who died from injuries sustained during the riot.
