new video loaded: Trump’s Defense Team Declares Trial An ‘Act of Political Vengeance’transcriptThe article of impeachment now before the Senate is an unjust and blatantly unconstitutional act of political vengeance. This appalling abuse of the Constitution only further divides our nation when we should be trying to come together around shared priorities.

The Senate should promptly and decisively vote to reject it.” “Throughout the course of today, my colleagues and I will explain in some detail the simple fact that President Trump did not incite the horrific, terrible riots of Jan. 6 will demonstrate that to the contrary the violence and looting goes against the law and order message he conveyed to every citizen of the United States throughout his presidency, including on Jan. 6.”1:371:57LIVE1:253:521:191:584:001:110:59
