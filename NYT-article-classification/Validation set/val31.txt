new video loaded: Prosecution Drops Call for Witnesses in Trump Impeachment Trialtranscript“Donald John Trump, by his counsel, is prepared to stipulate that if Representative Herrera Beutler were to testify under oath as part of these proceedings, her testimony would be consistent with the statement she issued on Feb. 12, 2021. And the former president’s counsel is agreeable to the admission of that public statement into evidence at this time.” “The managers are prepared to enter into the agreement. I will now read the statement. This is the statement of Congresswoman Jaime Herrera Beutler, Feb. 12, 2021. ‘In my Jan. 12 statement in support of the article of impeachment, I referenced a conversation House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy relayed to me that he’d had with President Trump while the Jan. 6 attack was ongoing. Here are the details. When McCarthy finally reached the president on Jan. 6 and asked him to publicly and forcefully call off the riot, the president initially repeated the falsehood that it was Antifa that had breached the Capitol. McCarthy refuted that and told the president that these were Trump supporters. That’s when, according to McCarthy, the president said, ‘Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are.’ Mister president, I now move that the Senate admit the statement into evidence.” “Without objection, the statement will be admitted into evidence.”NOW PLAYING1:57LIVE1:253:521:191:584:001:110:59
