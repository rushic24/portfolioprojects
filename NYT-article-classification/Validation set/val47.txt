new video loaded: Question Phase of Trump’s Impeachment Trial Grows Heatedtranscript“If we do not convict former President Trump, what message will we be sending to future presidents and Congresses?” “The consequences of his conduct were devastating on every level. Police officers were left overwhelmed, unprotected; Congress had to be evacuated; our staff barricaded in this building, calling their families to say goodbye. And the world watched us. And the world is still watching us to see what we will do this day. And will know what we did this day 100 years from now.” “Is it not true that under this new precedent, a future House facing partisan pressure to ‘lock her up’ could impeach a former secretary of state and a future Senate be forced to put her on trial and potentially disqualify from any future office?” “In this case, we have a president who committed his crimes against the republic while he was in office. He was impeached by the House of Representatives while he was in office.” “Mr. Raskin can’t tell you on what grounds you acquit. If you believe, even though there was a vote, that there’s jurisdiction, if you believe jurisdiction is unconstitutional, you can still believe that. If you believe that the House did not give appropriate due process in this, that can be your reason to acquit.” “It is clear that President Trump’s plot to undermine the 2020 election was built on lies and conspiracy theories. How did this plot to unconstitutionally keep President Trump in power lead to the radicalization of so many of President Trump’s followers and the resulting attack on the Capitol?” “What our commander in chief did was the polar opposite of what we’re supposed to do. We let the people decide the elections. Except President Trump. He directed all of that rage that he had incited to January 6th.” “Are the prosecutors right when they claim that Trump was telling a big lie? Or in your judgment, did Trump actually win the election?” “Who asked that?” [Sen. Bernie Sanders] “I did.” “My judgment is irrelevant in this proceeding. It absolutely is. What’s supposed to happen here is the article of impeachment is supposed to be —” [Sen. Patrick Leahy] “The Senate will be in order.” “What’s relevant in this impeachment article is: Were Mr. Trump’s words inciteful to the point of violence and riot? That’s the charge. That’s the question. And the answer is no.” “If the Senate’s power to disqualify is not derivative of the power to remove a convicted president from office, could the Senate disqualify a sitting president but not remove him or her?” “Mr. Castro attributed a statement, the time before last that he was up here, that Donald Trump had told his people to fight to the death. I’m not from here — I’m not like you guys — I was being very polite and giving him an opportunity to correct the record. And I thought that’s exactly what he would do. But instead, what he did is he came up and illustrated the problem with the presentation of the House case. It’s been smoke and mirrors, and worse, it’s been dishonest.”1:371:57LIVE1:253:521:191:58NOW PLAYING1:110:59
