Trump were forced to relive the first mass siege of the Capitol since British invaders ransacked the building in 1814.transcript“Radio communications from the Metropolitan Police Department highlight how, during and and following President Trump’s speech, Trump supporters descended on the Capitol, and became increasingly violent. What you are about to hear has not been made public before.” “In another radio communication between Metropolitan Police officers, you can hear an officer declare that there is a riot at the capital at 1:49 p.m.” “We are seeing the inside view as the mob approaches from outside and beats the windows and doors. You can see that the rioters first broke the window with the wooden beam that you saw previously, and a lone police officer inside responds and begins to spray the first man who enters, but is quickly overwhelmed. I want you to pay attention to the first group of assailants as they break into the building. The second man through the window is wearing full tactical body armor and is carrying a baseball bat. Others are carrying riot shields. Among this group are members of the Proud Boys, some of whom, like Dominic Pezzola, who was recently indicted on federal conspiracy charges, we will discuss later. In this security footage, you can see Officer Goodman running to respond to the initial breach. Officer Goodman passes Senator Mitt Romney, and directs him to turn around in order to get to safety. On the first floor, just beneath them, the mob had already started to search for the Senate chamber. Officer Goodman made his way down to the first floor. On the left-hand side of the video, just inside the hallway, is the door to the Senate chamber. And watch how officer Goodman provokes the rioters and purposefully draws them away from the door to the Senate chamber and towards the other officers waiting down the hall. The rioter seen carrying a baseball bat in this video is the same one we saw moments ago, breaching the window on the first floor. While all of this was going on, Vice President Pence was still in the room near the Senate chamber. It was not until to 2:26 that he was evacuated to a secure location. This next security video shows that evacuation. His movements are depicted by the orange dot in our model — the red and blue dots represent the location where the mob and Officer Goodman were, and where Officer Goodman led the mob away from the chamber, just moments ago. You can see Vice President Pence and his family quickly moved down the stairs. The vice president turns around briefly as he’s headed down. About the same time Capitol Police announced the Capitol had been breached, Speaker Pelosi’s staff heeded the call to shelter in place. As you can see here, the staff moves from their offices, through the halls, and then enters a door on the right hand side. That’s the outer door of a conference room, which also has an inner door that they barricaded with furniture. The staff then hid under a conference room table in that inner room. This is the last staffer going in and then barricading themselves inside of the inner office. After just seven minutes of them barricading themselves, and the last staffer entering the door on the right, a group of rioters entered the hallway outside. And once inside, the rioters have free rein in the speaker of the House’s offices. In this security video, pay attention to the door that we saw those staffers leading into and going into. One of the rioters, you can see, is throwing his body against the door three times until he breaks open that outer door. Luckily, when faced with the inner door, he moves on.” “This security footage, which does not have sound, shows a close-up of Trump’s mob as they move toward the second floor of the House chamber to stop the counting of votes. This security video shows Ashli Babbitt, followed by others in the mob, turning the corner toward the House lobby doors where the members were leaving. This security video from 2:56 p.m. shows the mob in the House of Representatives wing on the second floor of the Capitol. Insurrectionists who are still inside the building are fighting with the police, who are overwhelmed and trying to get them out. In this security video, you can see how the Capitol Police created a line and blocked the hallway with their bodies to prevent rioters at the end of the hall from reaching you and your staff. Additional security footage shows how leader Schumer and the members of his protective detail had a near miss with the mob. They came within just yards of rioters and had to turn around. Going up the ramp with his detail, he’ll soon go out of view. Seconds later, they return and run back down the hallway, and officers immediately shut the door and use their bodies to keep them safe. Here’s an audio recording from the radio traffic of the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department describing the violence.” “In a separate Metropolitan Police Department radio traffic recording, you can hear an officer when he realizes that the insurrectionists had overtaken the police line.” “Hours after members of the House and Senate had left this area, on the west front of the building, the mob continued to grow, continued to beat the officers as they tried to get in. In this new security video, you can see the mob attacking officers with a crutch, a hockey stick, a bullhorn and a Trump flag.”By Peter BakerIt was ghastly to watch, but that was the point. A rampaging crowd threatening death as it hunted the vice president and speaker of the House. Senators spinning around midstep to run for their lives. Staff members barricading themselves in an office as attackers pounded on the door. Overwhelmed police officers retreating from rioters, desperately calling for help.It seems safe to assume that never in American history has such gut-churning video footage been shown on the floor of the Senate, where matters of great weight have been debated but hardly brought home in such a visually powerful way. The images shown in former President Donald J. Trump’s impeachment trial on Wednesday were all the more resonant because some of the jurors themselves were onscreen.The display of never-before-seen video from Capitol security cameras, along with newly disclosed police dispatch audiotapes, brought the mob assault of Jan. 6 back to life as mere words from the House managers prosecuting Mr. Trump never could. The terror of that day felt palpably real all over again as senators sitting in judgment of the former president were forced to relive the first mass siege of the Capitol since British invaders ransacked the building in 1814.The emotions inside and outside the Senate chamber were raw as the sun set on Wednesday evening after the House managers sought to use the montage of wrenching pictures to drive home their case against Mr. Trump. Some current and former senators struggled to regain their composure after watching, which was exactly the reaction that the managers were trying to generate.“I’m angry, I’m disturbed, I’m sad,” Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican of Alaska who has been critical of Mr. Trump’s actions, told reporters afterward. Even after living through the attack on the Capitol that day, she said, she found the video shown by the managers eye-opening. “I knew what it meant to be running down this hallway with my colleagues. I wasn’t fully aware of everything else that was happening in the building.”But it was not clear that it would change the overall dynamics of a trial governed largely by partisan divisions, with most Republicans still backing Mr. Trump and likely to block the two-thirds vote required for conviction. Several of his Republican allies said afterward that they too found the video images distressing but did not consider them the former president’s fault.“Today’s presentation was powerful and emotional reliving a terrorist attack on our nation’s capital,” said Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas. “But there was very little said about how specific conduct of the president’s satisfies the legal standard” of convicting him of high crimes and misdemeanors.As former Senator Doug Jones, Democrat of Alabama, wryly described his onetime Republican colleagues on Twitter: “Apparently shaken, but not stirred.”There was a lot to be shaken about. The footage from Capitol security cameras showed Vice President Mike Pence, who had alienated Mr. Trump’s supporters by refusing to try to overturn the election as the president had demanded, being rushed with his family by Secret Service agents down a staircase to escape invaders calling for his death. Young aides to Speaker Nancy Pelosi were shown scrambling into an office and barricading themselves inside just minutes before the mob arrived and tried to break down the door.Other clips showed Eugene Goodman, a Capitol Police officer famous for facing the mob alone, encountering Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, and warning him about the danger, prompting the senator to abruptly spin around and run the other way to safety. Likewise, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, was seen being led away by his security detail only to suddenly realize they were heading toward the rioters, forcing them to turn and race in the opposite direction.“They were within 100 feet of where the vice president was sheltering with his family,” Stacey Plaskett, a Democratic delegate from the Virgin Islands and one of the House impeachment managers, told the senators sitting as jurors. “They were just feet away from one of the doors to this chamber where many of you remained at that time.”She and Representative Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California, played police dispatch audio recordings and cited legal filings, social media postings and videos to make clear that the rioters posed a serious danger to Mr. Pence, Ms. Pelosi and other lawmakers as well as to police officers, some of whom sounded nearly panicked pleading for backup.“Hang Mike Pence! Hang Mike Pence!” the crowd could be heard chanting. Outside the Capitol, where a gallows had been set up, others called out, “Bring out Pence!” One rioter taped a video saying, “He’s a total treasonous pig.”They likewise were searching for Ms. Pelosi, and Ms. Plaskett pointed out that the intruder photographed sitting at a desk in her office was actually carrying a 950,000-volt stun gun walking stick. “Where are you, Nancy?” some of the rioters called out. “We’re looking for you!”Over the police radio tape played for the senators, officers could be heard effectively narrating the escalating threat to the building — and to them.“They’re throwing metal poles at us.”“We need some reinforcements up here now.”“We have been flanked and we’ve lost the line.”To make the point even more vivid, the managers created a graphic representation of the Capitol using menacing red dots to show the progress of the mob as it invaded the building and approached the chambers where senators and House members were meeting to count the Electoral College votes ratifying the victory of Joseph R. Biden Jr. over Mr. Trump.“Again, that is a mob that was sent by the president of the United States to stop the certification of an election,” Ms. Plaskett told the Senate. “The vice president, the speaker of the House — the first and second in line to the presidency — were performing their constitutional duties presiding over the election certification and they were put in danger because President Trump put his own desires, his own need for power, over his duty to the Constitution and our democratic process.”“President Trump,” she added, “put a target on their backs and his mob broke into the Capitol to hunt them down.”The video footage was the culmination of a methodical presentation by the managers arguing that Mr. Trump’s incitement of the insurrection began months before Jan. 6 with the propagation of what they called the “Big Lie” that the election would be stolen if he lost. The managers laid out the timeline of the president’s efforts to inflame supporters, setting the stage for the eventual outburst of violence at the Capitol.The president, they added, cared not about the havoc he had unleashed but continued to push his efforts to block the Electoral College count even after the attack began. The video showing Mr. Pence being evacuated was time-stamped at 2:26 p.m. — just two minutes after Mr. Trump posted on Twitter attacking his own vice president for not trying to overturn the election: “Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution.”Even at that point, the managers told the senators on Wednesday, Mr. Trump disregarded pleas from his aides and allies to intervene to explicitly call on the mob to stop the attack, issuing instead only a belated and mildly worded video telling supporters to be peaceful and return home even as he embraced them. “We love you,” he said at the time. “You’re very special.”
