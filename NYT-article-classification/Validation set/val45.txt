new video loaded: Donald Trump ‘Lit the Flame,’ Rep. Castro SaystranscriptDonald Trump summoned the mob, he assembled a mob and he lit the flame. Everything that followed was because of his doing. And although he could have immediately and forcefully intervened to stop the violence, he never did. In other words, this violent, bloody insurrection that occurred on Jan. 6 would not have occurred but for President Trump. The evidence we presented at trial makes this absolutely clear. This attack, as we said, didn’t come from one random speech and it didn’t happen by accident. And that mob didn’t come out of thin air. Before the election, Donald Trump spread lie after lie about potential fraud in an election, remember, that hadn’t even happened yet. Months before the election took place, he was saying it was rigged, that it was going to be stolen, all to make his supporters believe that the only way he was going to lose is if the election was stolen, if the election was rigged. And remember, this is in the United States where our vote is our voice. You tell somebody that an election victory is being stolen from them, that’s a combustible situation. And he gave them clear direction on how to deal with that.1:371:57LIVE1:253:52NOW PLAYING1:584:001:110:59
